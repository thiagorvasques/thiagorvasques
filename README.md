- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @thiagorvasques. After many years working in differente positions I decided to pusrue a career in IT. 
I completed Udacity's course Introcudtion to Data Science with python and realized I had a lack of the basics in Computer Science so I took
CS50 course, wich I'm on the final project now and starting The Odin Project alongside with some freecodecamp exercises, my goal is to start working 
with web development in the near future.
