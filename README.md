Hi, I graduated in Business in 2007 and I'm trying to start a late carrer as web developer.
I've been studying on my own for almost one year now, the courses I took were:
  
CS50 - 100%  
Javascrip path at The Odin  Project - 90%  
fullstackopen - 100%  
  
And other smaller courses in different subjects. I'm looking for an oppporunity to apply what 
I learned and to learn more alongside with experienced developers.


Skills: Nodejs, Express, React, Redux, MongoDb, Graphql.
